# Computer Graphics Projects

This repository contains three computer graphics projects created as part of my university assignments. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of interactive graphics and animation using Pygame in Python. These projects showcase skills in game mechanics, visual effects, and user interaction.

## Project 3: Raining on House

### Description
**Raining on House** simulates a rain effect over a house background. The project uses Pygame to animate raindrops that fall from the top of the screen to the bottom, creating a realistic rain effect.

### Features
- Raindrops fall at a constant rate and disappear when they reach the bottom.
- House background provides a realistic environment for the rain.
- Raindrops reset when they fall off the screen, simulating continuous rain.

### How to Run
Simply start the script to see the rain animation over the house background.
